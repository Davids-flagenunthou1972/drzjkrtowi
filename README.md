OMG, just finished watching The Legend of Ochi, and I‚Äôm like, seriously?? How is this not more talked about? The whole vibe was insane, and not in the I'm losing my mind way ‚Äî more like, ‚ÄúWhy am I so emotionally attached to a fictional creature right now??‚Äù

Did you see those scenes with the landscapes? ü§Ø I swear, it made me wanna just dive into the screen and never come back, like, bye reality!! But at the same time, I was kinda over it. Dunno if it was the music or what, but parts of it were dragging. You know what I mean, right? üòÇ

I mean, there‚Äôs this one part where I legit thought my heart stopped. Like, can animation even do that?? But then, outta nowhere, they're back to the same ol‚Äô story pace. Bruh, pick a lane!

> It's like they wanted to mess with our feelings on purpose, which is kinda evil, but I'm here for it? Haha, every time I thought I had figured it out, bam! Plot twist! Thank god I decided not to download the movie, would've made my phone cry from storage space probs.

Anyways, the creature design. Lol, at one point, I was thinking, so they've let someone‚Äôs daydreaming sketchbook ideas become a whole animated film. Not mad about it, tho. The Ochi is like my dream pet now! Imagine walking it in the park üòÇ

And the endings. Ugh, they always try to ‚Äúleave it open-ended‚Äù like that‚Äôs a thing we enjoy! Y'know, sometimes I just wanna know where they all end up. Even if it‚Äôs just, like, and then they ate pizza forever. Is that too much to ask??

float myMood = confused ? excited : tired; // does this even matter now?

Anyway hey, if you get the chance to watch the movie, totally do it, and then we should def gossip about it in proper detail! Just make sure you have snacks, 'cause you‚Äôre gonna be there for a while, trust me!
